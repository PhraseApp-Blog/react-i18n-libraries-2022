# React i18n Demos

This demo app is a companion to a Phrase blog tutorial.

## Running the app

1. Clone this repo and run `npm install` from the command line, at the project root.
1. Run `npm run dev` from the command line.

The starter app, before i18n, can be found at the [start branch](https://github.com/PhraseApp-Blog/react-i18n-libraries-2022/tree/start)
of this repo.

## i18n libraries

The app was localized using a few React i18n libraries. Each library has
its own branch:

- [react-i18next](https://github.com/PhraseApp-Blog/react-i18n-libraries-2022/tree/react-i18next)
- [react-intl](https://github.com/PhraseApp-Blog/react-i18n-libraries-2022/tree/react-intl)
- [lingui](https://github.com/PhraseApp-Blog/react-i18n-libraries-2022/tree/lingui)
